## Conclusion

### Properties:
- **Physical Properties**: 
  - Atomic Mass
  - Number of Neutrons
  - Number of Protons
  - Number of Electrons
  - Period
  - Group
  - Phase
  - Density
  - Melting Point
  - Boiling Point
  - Number of Isotopes
  - Specific Heat
  - Number of Shells

- **Chemical Nature**:
  - Radioactive
  - Natural
  - Type
  - Atomic Radius
  - Electronegativity
  - First Ionization
  - Number of Valence Electrons

The distinction lies in how these properties relate to the behavior, structure, and composition of the elements. Physical properties are primarily concerned with the state of matter, mass, and energy exchange, while chemical properties focus on atomic and molecular interactions, reactivity, and atomic structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Strong Correlations**:
   - **Atomic Mass** & [Number of Shells, Period]
   - **Number of Electrons** & [Number of Shells, Period]
   - **Group** & Number of Valence Electrons
   - **Atomic Radius** & [Electronegativity, First Ionization Energy]
   - **Electronegativity** & First Ionization Energy
   - **Price** & [First Ionization Energy, Electronegativity, Atomic Radius, Group]

2. **Transition Metals**: 
   - Transition metals have the highest properties and therefore command the highest prices. Let's find out more! üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èü§óü§ó

3. **Atomic Mass**:
   - There may be some correlation between the atomic mass of a metal and its price, but it's not a strict rule. Some heavy metals may be more valuable due to their scarcity or specific applications.

4. **Number of Neutrons, Number of Electrons/Protons**:
   - These properties are intrinsic to the metal's composition. Changes in these values might affect the metal's stability and behavior in reactions, but their direct impact on price could be indirect.

5. **Melting Point, Boiling Point**:
   - These properties relate to phase transitions from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. While they may influence price (e.g., high melting points for metals used in high-temperature applications), they are not primary determinants.

6. **Electronegativity**:
   - Transition metals generally have moderate electronegativity values. The price might be influenced by their reactivity and use in various applications, but direct correlations may be complex.

7. **First Ionization**:
   - The energy required to remove the first electron. Transition metals may exhibit variable ionization energies. The relationship with price is likely indirect and influenced by factors such as reactivity and demand.

8. **Density**:
   - Transition metals often have high densities, which can impact their applications, but this is not necessarily a primary factor in determining price.
