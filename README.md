Conclusion
Proparties:
Physical Properties: [AtomicMass, Number of Neutrons, Number of Protons, Number of Electrons, Period, Group, Phase, Density, Melting Point,Boiling Point, Number Of Isotopes,Specific Heat, Number of Shells]

ChemicalNature: [Radioactive, Natural, Type, Atomic Radius,Electronegativity, First Ionization ,Number of Valence]

The distinction lies in how these properties relate to the behavior, structure, and composition of the elements. Those classified as physical properties are primarily concerned with the state of matter, mass, and energy exchange, while the chemical properties focus on atomic and molecular interactions, reactivity, and atomic structure.

1-There are a strong correlation between:
Atomic mass & [ NO.shells, Period ]
NO. Electons & [No.shells, period]
Group & NO.velance
Atomic Radius & [ElectroNegativity, First Ionization]
ElectroNegativity & First Ionization
Price & [First Ionization, ElectroNegativity, Atomic Radius, Group]

2-Transition Metals have the highest properties and therefore the highest price,Let's find out!!üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èü§óü§ó
3-Atomic Mass: There may be some correlation between the atomic mass of a metal and its price, but it's not a strict rule. Some heavy metals may be more valuable due to their scarcity or specific applications.
Number of Neutrons, Number of Electrons/Protons: These properties are more intrinsic to the metal's composition. Changes in these values might affect the metal's stability and behavior in reactions, but their direct impact on price could be indirect.
4-Melting Point, Boiling Point: These properties are related to the metal's phase transition from solid to liquid and liquid to gas, respectively. While there might be some influence on price (e.g., high melting points in metals used in high-temperature applications), it's not the primary determinant.
5-Electronegativity: Transition metals generally have moderate electronegativity values. The price might be influenced by their reactivity and use in various applications, but a direct correlation may not be straightforward.
First Ionization: The energy required to remove the first electron. Transition metals may exhibit variable ionization energies. The relationship with price is likely indirect and influenced by factors like reactivity and demand.
Density: Transition metals often have high densities. This can impact their applications, but it might not be a primary factor in determining price.
